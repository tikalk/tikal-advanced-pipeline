Following our successful meetup, I’d like to share the slides with you.

•  Tlak 1-  by me. 
In the 1st part of the talk will focus on the new "Dimensions" of monitoring and how a Modern monitoring system should look like. 

No, there is no one size fit all every Monitoring system has its challenges considering the # of endpoints the # of services and their corresponding metrics.

In the 2nd part, We will be focusing on Prometheus as a Modern Monitoring solution which unfolds many of those principles. 
At the end of the talk, I will be Demoing a monitored system and take a look on how we built it with Prometheus built-in discovery capabilities.

•  Talk 2 - by Salo Shp. DevOps Architect.
We'll cover an alternate monitoring solution stack, and demonstrate how to collect metrics with Telegraf, store in Elastic, and dashboards via Grafana. 
Additionally, W'll show how one can monitor its Consul services state, and hook this data to that solution stack easily.
